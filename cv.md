## __About myself:__
 When I was working as a manager at Company M, a friend offered me a part-time job developing a website. The main tasks of the project were quite simple: uploading content, "web design" and customizing templates, fixing bugs, etc. Despite this, I was deeply interested in the subject. It turned out that the work can be not only useful but also interesting. As a result, we (the project team) closed our small tasks and successfully parted ways. However, my curiosity continues to grow and has led me to the present moment.
